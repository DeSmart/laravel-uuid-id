Package provides a simple trait that allows to use UUIDs as IDs in Laravel models.

## Installation
To install the package via Composer, simply run the following command:
```
composer require desmart/laravel-uuid-id
```

## Usage
This package does two things:
* enables having UUID as an ID (by modifying some underlying Laravel model methods), and
* automatically generates ordered UUID as an ID during model creation.

In any Laravel model that should use UUID as an ID, add `HasUuidId` trait:
```php
class MyModel extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
{
    use \DeSmart\Laravel\Uuid\HasUuidId;
}
```
